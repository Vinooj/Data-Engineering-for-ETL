## **How to build resilient data pipelines**

Resilient data pipelines are designed to withstand disruptions and maintain data integrity and availability, even during failures or unexpected events. They are characterized by their ability to adapt to changes, recover from errors, and ensure smooth data flow. .

✅ Resilenct to Sceme chnages.

✅ Handling API rate limits that throttle your ingestion, delaying critical data.

✅ Write structured and easily maintanable code.

### **Key Characteristics:**
- **Adaptability**: Resilient pipelines can handle schema changes, data format variations, and other unexpected changes in the data stream without major disruption. 
- **Error Handling**: They include mechanisms to detect and recover from errors, such as failed tasks, network outages, or data corruption. 
- **Fault Tolerance**: Resilient pipelines are built to tolerate failures in individual components without causing the entire pipeline to shut down. 
- **Observability and Monitoring**: They provide tools to monitor pipeline performance, identify bottlenecks, and track data quality. 
- **Scalability**: Resilient pipelines should be able to handle increasing volumes of data and adapt to changing data sources and destinations. 
- **Business Continuity**: They ensure that data is accessible and usable even during disruptions, minimizing the impact on business operations. 

**Here’s the reality:** Most engineers can write a script to move data from A to B. But many do not think ahead—designing for resilience, scalability, and automation.

This course I took is beyond basic ETL. It’s about approaching ingestion with resiliency in mind — so you can build pipelines that just work (even when the world around them changes).
